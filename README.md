# Watcher of Friends Online

This script return list your friends online in [vk.com](https://vk.com])

# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

# Quick start

```bash
$ python3 vk_friends_online.py
```

Running on Windows is similar.

*(Possibly requires call of 'python' executive instead of just 'python3'.)*

# Example

```bash
Login: my_login
Password: 
Friends online:
Pope Paul
Day Marcus
Lawrence Ashley
Scott Brice
Chapman Clifton
```
